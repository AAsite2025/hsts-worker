## 🔐 Injected Header

## ✨ Why It Matters

- **Security**: Prevents protocol downgrade and SSL stripping attacks  
- **Trust**: Signals to browsers and users that this space is secure  
- **Preload Eligibility**: Meets criteria for inclusion in browser preload lists

## 🛠️ Usage

Deploy via Cloudflare Workers using Wrangler. This script lives in `src/index.js`.

## 🙏 Intention

This repository is part of a larger offering—where every header, redirect, and DNS record is placed with care. May it serve with integrity.
